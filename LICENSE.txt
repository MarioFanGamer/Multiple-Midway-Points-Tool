This software is made in three components:
- MMP.exe: The main program
- Midway.dll: The kernel
- Asar.dll: The 65c816 assembler made by Alcaro

The software as a whole (except Asar.dll which belongs to Alcaro) and the source code of MMP.exe is released under the GNU General Public License v3. You can find the license under licenses/license-gpl.exe.
Midway.dll is licensed under GNU Lesser General Public License v3. You can find the license under licenses/license-lgpl.txt.
Asar.dll doesn't belong to me, MarioFanGamer, but rather to the aforementioned Alcaro. You can see its license in licenses/license-asar.txt.
